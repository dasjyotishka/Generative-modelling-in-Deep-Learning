# Generative-modelling-in-Deep-Learning

##Objective
In this work, I have focused on two of the most widely used generative models based on deep neural networks: Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) and Variational AutoEncoders (VAEs), in order to compare them and understand their strengths and weaknesses. This notebook was created as a part of an assignment on a course on Advanced Deep Learning at CentraleSup√©lec.
